# wasta-custom-png-manus: wasta-menus-default-apps-png-manus.txt
#
# This file should contain all the default wasta-menus apps for wasta-Linux
#   PNG Manus users.
#
# These app symlinks are create in:
#
#   /usr/share/wasta-base-setup/wasta-menus/applications
#
#   by the wasta-base-postinst.sh script. These are in turn linked to
#   /usr/share/wasta-menus/applications ONLY IF that folder doesn't already
#   exist (this prevents any wasta-custom-xyz package customizations of the
#   default wasta-menus app list from being overwritten when wasta-base-setup
#   is updated).
#
# Any blank line or a line beginning with a '#' will be ignored.  Also, if an
#   application is not installed, it does not hurt to have it defined here.  For
#   example, it is OK to have an "Adapt It" specification here even if Adapt It
#   is not installed.  Later if Adapt It is installed, it will show in wasta-menus.
